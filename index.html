			<h2><strong>Cao Research Group</strong></h2>
			<pwhite> The Cao research group is led by Dr. Lei Cao, associate professor in Mechanical Engineering. We strive to understand microscopic mechanisms governing the mechanical properties of materials. We develop and use advanced phase-field methods, molecular dynamics, and density-functional theory to explore various physical processes critical to the mechanical properties of materials.</pwhite>

        <p>"One common thing I get asked is how I feel about choosing the field of engineering as a woman or if I feel a sort of responsibility, and I do feel a responsibility," Cao said. "I think it's very important to have more women engineers in the STEM field because we don't realize how important it is to have role models for students." </p>

        <p>Cao’s project involves developing computer models that can predict how microstructures within titanium alloys change under heat and pressure. The computer models can connect atomic-level material processes to design macroscopic material properties by rationally designing microstructures. The project also will advance another of her goals: preparing students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) for the workforce by with integrated skills in mechanical engineering and materials science. </p>
